    This folder is for images for the whole project!

    PLEASE be specific with image names you put in here to make it easier for 
when we implement them into the code :-)

    GREAT places for images that are free of copyright to use are:
    -> unsplash.com
    -> pixabay.com
    -> burst.shopify.com
    -> pexels.com
    -> freeimages.com
    -> kaboompics.com
    -> stocksnap.io
    -> Don't like those? When you search on Google Images, Press 'Tools',
        then under 'Usage Rights', select 'Creative Commons Licenses'
